        <div class="description">
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>I'm S. Praveen Kumar, a Computer Science student at Vishnu Institute of Technology,
                and I'm enthusiastic about transitioning my career into the captivating realm of Internet of Things (IoT).
                I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and have a Diploma from A.A.N.M & V.V.R.S.R Polytechnic College.
                While I'm still a student, I've gained valuable experience through IoT-related internships.
                My technical skills encompass Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Arduino, NoSQL, MongoDB, Internet of Things, Google Cloud, and various Microsoft Office tools.
                In addition to my technical proficiency, I possess soft skills, including strong problem-solving, time management, creativity, adaptability, teamwork, and leadership.
                I've undertaken projects such as building an Obstacle-Avoiding Robot and a Light-Following Robot using LDR. During my diploma,
                I developed a Student Portal that allows students to access their marks and attendance. Beyond my academic pursuits, I find joy in watching movies and nature photography,
                and I'm passionate about AI image generation. I enjoy playing games, practicing yoga, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
                <span> My ultimate goal is to deepen my knowledge in IoT and establish my own startup company specializing in smart home automation.</span>
                 Currently, I'm engaged in a personal project that combines both software and IoT components, and I'm actively seeking internship opportunities in the IoT field to further enhance my skills and experiences.</p>
